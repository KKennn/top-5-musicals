    <h2>Dear Evan Hansen</h2>
    <img src="images/DEH.jpg">
    <p>A letter that was never meant to be seen, a lie that was never meant to be told, a life he never dreamed he could have. Evan Hansen is about to get the one thing he’s always wanted: A chance to finally fit in. Both deeply personal and profoundly contemporary,
        Dear Evan Hansen is the new American musical about life and the way we live it.</p>

    <h2>Moulin Rouge!</h2>
    <img src="images/MR.jpg">
    <p>Set in Montmartre Quarter of Paris, France at the turn of the century, a world of indulgent beauty and unparalleled extravagance, of bohemians and aristocrats, of boulevardiers and mademoiselles, Moulin Rouge! The Musical tells the fictional story
        of an ambitious, lovesick writer, Christian, and a dazzling, entrancing chanteuse, Satine. Their lives collide at the Moulin Rouge with its many characters including the host of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler, the brilliant and starving artist
        Toulouse-Lautrec, the greatest tango dancer - and gigolo - in all of Paris, Santiago, the tempting Nini, and The Duke of Monroth, the wealthy and entitled patron of the club who thinks he can buy anything he wants, including love.</p>

    <h2>Chicago</h2>
    <img src="images/Chicago.jpg">
    <p>A true New York City institution, Chicago has everything that makes Broadway great: a universal tale of fame, fortune and all that jazz; one show-stopping song after another; and the most astonishing dancing you’ve ever seen. Now in its 20th year
        on Broadway, Chicago is the longest-running American musical in Broadway history and the second longest-running Broadway production ever.</p>
